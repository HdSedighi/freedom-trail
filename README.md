# Intuition
The problem can be solved using a dynamic programming approach, where we keep track of the minimum steps required to spell the key using the ring. At each step, we want to align the ring so that the current key character is at the "12:00" direction. To do this, we need to calculate the distance to rotate the ring in both clockwise and counterclockwise directions and choose the shorter distance. By iterating through each character in the key and each character in the ring, we can update the minimum steps required to spell the key.

# Approach
1. Dictionary Mapping: Create a dictionary mapping each character in the ring to its positions in the ring. This will help us quickly find the positions of each key character in the ring.
2. Dynamic Programming: Use a 2D array dp where dp[i][j] represents the minimum steps to spell the first i characters of the key when the j-th character of the ring is at the "12:00" position.
3. Initialization: Initialize dp[0][j] for all j as zero because at the beginning, we haven't spelled any characters of the key.
4. Iterate through Key: For each character in the key, iterate through the ring's positions and calculate the minimum steps required to align the ring such that the current key character is at the "12:00" direction.
5. Rotation Calculation: Calculate the clockwise and counterclockwise distance from each current position in the ring to the target position of the current key character. Update dp array with the minimum steps.
6. Final Result: The final result is the minimum value in the last row of the dp array, which represents the minimum steps to spell the entire key.

# Complexity
- Time complexity: The time complexity is O(n⋅m), where n is the length of the key and m is the length of the ring. This is because we iterate through each character in the key and for each key character, we iterate through each character in the ring.
- Space complexity: The space complexity is O(n⋅m), where n is the length of the key and m is the length of the ring. This is because we maintain a 2D dp array with dimensions of the lengths of the key and the ring.
